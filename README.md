# filter-combinator-updated

Factorio mod to add a signal filter combinator. Forked from https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Filter_Combinator with updates.

To migrate, just install this instead of the original mod, then load a save and choose to _not_ sync. Once migrated (and saved), the previous mod will have compatibility issues.
