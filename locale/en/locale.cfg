[mod-setting-description]
filter-combinator-output-slots=The max amount of signals each filter combinator can output. Increasing it can degrade performance!
filter-combinator-update-ticks=The number of ticks between signal updates. Increasing it can improve performance, at the cost of delaying (or even missing) signal changes. If the signals being passed to the filter combinator are relatively constant, you can set this higher. If this is decreased then you should consider decreasing "Filter Combinator Output Slots".
filter-combinator-reactivate-seconds=After how many seconds will the filter combinator be reactivated after it has been disabled for overflowing. Too low values can affect performance. Note that the combinator will only be re-enabled if it is no longer overflowing.

[gui-alert-tooltip]
filter-combinator-overflow=Filter combinator is overflowing and will be deactivated! It can only output up to __1__ signals!
